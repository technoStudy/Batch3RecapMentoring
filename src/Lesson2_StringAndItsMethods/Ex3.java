    We'll say that a String is xy-balanced if for all the 'x' chars in the string,
    there exists a 'y' char somewhere later in the string. So "xxy" is balanced,
    but "xyx" is not. One 'y' can balance multiple 'x's.
    Return true if the given string is xy-balanced.

"aaxbby" → true
"aaxbb" → false
"yaaxbb" → false
